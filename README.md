# Push Cert Alert - Fastlane Plugin

[![fastlane Plugin Badge](https://rawcdn.githack.com/fastlane/fastlane/master/fastlane/assets/plugin-badge.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/fastlane-plugin-push_cert_alert)

Fastlane's [PEM](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/pem/) tool provides amazing capabilities for generating new push certificates when the old one will expire.

But what if you just want to just check the expiration date without making modifications? Or alert your team on Slack when the date is approaching?

## Getting Started

This project is a [_fastlane_](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) plugin. To get started with `fastlane-plugin-push_cert_alert`, add it to your project by running:

```bash
fastlane add_plugin push_cert_alert
```

## About push_cert_alert

Generate alerts for when a push certificate will expire soon, or has expired already.

## Usage

> If you already use get_push_certificate (pem) and slack actions somewhere in your lanes then you are already configured.\
> Run `bundle exec fastlane action push_cert_alert` for more information.

Simply add `check_push_certificate` to some lane:

```ruby
lane :test do
    check_push_certificate
end
```

And you will receive a Slack alert when your cert has expired (or expires soon):

> An APNS push certificate expires in 30 days
>
> **Lane:** test\
> **Result:** Error\
> **App Identifier:** com.company.name\
> **Type:**  production\
> **Expires at:** 1955-11-05 11:11:11 UTC\
> **Name:** Apple Push Services

You can also add custom callbacks for the events if desired:

```ruby
check_push_certificate(
    active_days_limit: 60, # Default is 30
    skip_slack: true, # Defaults to true
    expires_soon: proc do |cert, days|
        puts "#{days} days until #{cert.name} expires. Perhaps you should run `get_push_certificate` soon to upgrade your push services."
    end,
    expired: proc do
        puts "ðŸš¨ DANGER - Our push cert is expired (or missing)!"
    end
)
```

## Integration

Integrate this lane with your other lanes and/or CI to be made aware early of any upcoming push certificate expiration.

### Circle CI
