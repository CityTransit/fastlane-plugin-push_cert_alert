[![fastlane Plugin Badge](https://rawcdn.githack.com/fastlane/fastlane/master/fastlane/assets/plugin-badge.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/fastlane-plugin-push_cert_alert)

## Getting Started

This project is a [_fastlane_](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) plugin. To get started with `fastlane-plugin-push_cert_alert`, add it to your project by running:

```bash
fastlane add_plugin push_cert_alert
```

## About push_cert_alert

Generate alerts for when a push certificate will expire soon, or has expired already.

## Usage

If you already use get_push_certificate (pem) and slack actions somewhere in your lanes then you are already configured.

Just run `push_cert_alert` from some lane:

```ruby
lane :test do
    push_cert_alert
end
```

And you will receive a Slack alert when your cert has expired (or expires soon):

> An APNS push certificate expires in 30 days
>
> **Lane**$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$**Result**\
> test    $~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$ Error
>
> **App Identifier**$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$**Type**\
> com.company.name  $~~~~~~~~~~$ production
>
> **Expires at**$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$**Name**\
> 1955-11-05 11:11:11 UTC $~~~~$ Apple Push Services

You can also add custom callbacks for the events if desired:

```ruby
push_cert_alert(
    active_days_limit: 60, # Default is 30
    skip_slack: true, # Defaults to true
    expires_soon: proc do |cert, days|
        puts "#{days} days until #{cert.name} expires. Perhaps you should run `get_push_certificate` soon to upgrade your push services."
    end,
    expired: proc do
        puts "ðŸš¨ DANGER - Our push cert is expired (or missing)!"
    end
)
```

Run `bundle exec fastlane action push_cert_alert` for more information.
